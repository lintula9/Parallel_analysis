Aims

:   1.  Discuss briefly the widely applied parallel analysis.
    2.  Show the bias-variance decomposition using the delta method for estimating the number of factors in two cases:
        -   Using the unadjusted original parallel analysis

        -   Using the adjusted parallel analysis

Central point is that the common factor model

$$
\Sigma = \Lambda\Psi\Lambda^T +\Omega
$$

implies that $\Sigma-\Omega$ is a rank $q$ matrix, where $q$ is the number of factors. This implies, that $\Sigma$ must have exactly $q$ non-zero eigenvalues $\lambda$. This causes a bias in the original Parallel Analysis because the asymptotic criteria function of

$$
c_{pa}\begin{cases}
\lambda \ge 1,& \text{keep} \\
\lambda < 1, & \text{do not keep}
\end{cases}
$$

as $n\to\infty$. This is because we do not adjust for the presence of eigenvalues of $\Omega$ which cannot all be orthogonal to eigenvalues of the factors contained in $\Lambda\Psi\Lambda^t$.
